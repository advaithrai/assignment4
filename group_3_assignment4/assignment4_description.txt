This animation contains a Car class, a Bird class, a Smoke class, and a subclass of Smoke, called Puff. The scene to be animated is a house, in front of which a car drives and two birds fly. There is also smoke that rises from the chimney of the house. In the animation, the red Car object moves horizontally in front of the car while the wheels of the car rotate. The mass of smoke coming from the chimmney of the house moves vertically upward, while individual plumes expand and dissipate as they move. A red bird and a brown bird are Bird objects, which move horizontally as they flap their wings up and down. Advaith Rai made the Car class, Alexander Macaskill made the Smoke class and Puff subclass, and Jina Zhou made the Bird class. Note - Advaith and Alex completed their portions of the assignment ahead of the deadline but Jina had to turn her portion in late, which is why the entire assignment is turned in one day late (will follow up with professor and TAs about this).
